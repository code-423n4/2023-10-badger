# Formal Verification Details

## Overview

The formal verification component of the contest is about using the Certora prover to formally verify properties in the Solidity smart contracts in scope. Wardens are incentivized to implement and verify high coverage properties. Submissions, incentives, and judging are different from the main contest so please read this document in its entirety.

## Scope

## Getting Started

The participation and submission process in this component of the contest will be different. Participants will need to create a private fork of this repo and give editor access to `teryanarmen`, `nd-certora`, and `mailalexjoseph`. Submission doesn't require any additional work once the judges have access to your repo. Note that commits after the deadline will be ignored and may disqualify you, so please ensure all work is completed by the deadline.

Work should be completed in the [certora](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-badger/blob/main/certora/) directory. Some tool configurations have been prepared for you. You can edit these as needed or create new ones. Please maintain the current structure and style of the directory. Only verified rules should be run with confs ending in `_verified` and should run all rules you want to be considered for the coverage, participation, and beginner awards. Please create additional confs with `_violated` ending for real bug catching properties. 

The contest will be judged using private and public mutations. Public mutations are available in the [certora directory](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-badger/blob/main/certora/mutations) and will be used for the participation reward calculation. Private mutations will be made public along with the contest results and will be used for the coverage and beginner reward calculation.

The Certora Prover installation instructions can be found [here](https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/docs/user-guide/getting-started/install.html?highlight=install). Briefly, you must install

- Java Development Kit version >= 17.
- Solidity version 0.8.17 (exactly this version).
- One can install Certora with the Python package manager Pip3,
  ```
  pip3 install certora-cli
  ```

Please make sure you are using certora-cli 4.13.1 for the whole contest.

## Incentives

The total reward is split into four categories: participation, real bugs, coverage, and beginner.

- Coverage rewards (60% of FV pool) are awarded for verified rules written for `ActivePool`,  `CollSurplusPool`, and `SortedCdps`
- Real bug rewards (20% of FV pool) are awarded for rules catching real bugs. 
- Participation rewards (10% of FV pool) are awarded for catching all [3 publicly available mutations](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-badger/blob/main/certora/mutations/).
- Beginner rewards (10% of FV pool) are awarded for coverage rules written for [EBTCToken](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-10-badger/blob/main/packages/contracts/contracts/EBTCToken.sol)

Coverage rewards are calculated based on coverage. Coverage is determined using private mutations to the code. The private mutations will be made public after the reward calculation. The value of each mutation decreases as more wardens catch it, similar to bugs in the audit contest component. There will be approximately 10 mutations per contract. Coverage rewards will not be awarded for contracts in the "beginner" scope (EBTCToken).

Real bug rewards are awarded for properties that catch real bugs. The real bug and all details must be submitted as a github issue in your private repo and should be a duplicate of your c4 submission. All real bug catching rules must catch bugs accepted by the c4 judge. A failing rule for a real bug is not necessary a valid rule, please make sure the property written is actually violated by the bug and verified once the bug is fixed.

Participation rewards will be evenly distributed amongst all those that catch the publicly available mutations.

Beginner rewards will be distributed similarly to coverage rewards but the scope is only the EBTCToken contract.

## Mutation Testing

Gambit confs have been provided for all the in scope contracts. To run mutation testing, you can do `certoraMutate --prover_conf certora/confs/contract_verified.conf --mutation_conf certora/confs/gambit/contract.conf`. You can change the number of bugs that are inject by adding manual mutations in the `mutations` folder in a similar fashion to the public mutations and by changing the value of automatic mutation in the contract's gambit conf.

## Additional Information

### How to create a private fork

Creating a private fork is fairly easy. To do so simply:

1. Go to your GitHub repository page and create an empty new private repository.

2. In your empty repository scroll all the way down and look for the "import code" button.

3. In the central textbox paste this public repository url and press the "Begin import" button.

And Voil√†, you have a private fork!
Now you can clone the repository to your local machine so that you'll be able to work:

1. In your repository, press the big green button saying "Code" and copy the url displayed there.

2. In your terminal, clone the repository by executing:

```
git clone <url> --recurse-submodules
```

- `--recurse-submodules` flag makes sure to initialize and clone the referenced submodules in the repository. This is not always needed, but it doesn't do any harm if no submodules exist.

You now have the git repository locally on your machine :). As a last step, we will add the parent public repository as a remote on our local repository, just in case we will need to sync something in the future:

1. In the repository add a remote by executing:

```
git remote add certora-repo <url>
```

where `<url>` is the same url retrieved from the big green "code" button on the parent public repository.

2. Check that the remote was added by executing:

```
git remote -v
```

3. Whenever you're required to sync your repository with changes introduced by Certora, you simply need to:

   3.1. Fetch the latest information from the remote

   ```
   git fetch `certora-repo`
   ```

   3.2. Checkout to the desired branch

   ```
   git checkout <branch>
   ```

   3.3. Pull the modified code from the origin (`certora-repo`) branch to the current branch you're standing on in your local machine by executing

   ```
   git pull certora-repo <branch> --recurse-submodules
   ```

   This last action should pull the code from the `certora-repo` remote and embed it into the branch you checked out to. You potentially need to sort out conflicts, but in general you code is now synced and ready to push to your private remote whenever you need to.


The forked repository will contain a `certora` directory that consists of 4 sub-directories - `harness`, `confs`, `mutations` and `specs`. These should contain the entire preliminary setup to allow you to start writing rules. Each sub-directory contains a different component of the verification project and may contain additional sub-directories to maintain organization. Try to keep a similar structure when adding new files.
