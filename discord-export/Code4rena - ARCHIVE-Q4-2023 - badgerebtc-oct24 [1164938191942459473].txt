and good luck to all wardens


[10/24/2023 20:13] czar102
Why are there two separate H/M pots? One within the c4 contest and one within the Certora contest‚Ä¶ Wouldn't it make more sense to leave fv coverage to certora and aggregate all issues in c4? Double submisson and double rewards don't make much sense to me‚Ä¶


[10/24/2023 20:15] czar102
Also, the rsvp posted 1999 sloc but just top 4 contracts in size exceed 2500 sloc‚Ä¶ How does it work?

for the certora work is it OK to create a branch in our private repo? I'd like to create an "audit" branch to not mess up my changes with the original repo; I have no problem in making the "audit" branch the default one on GH

Or foundryup probably, never saw that error

Added the `forge coverage` output to the Cheatsheet: https://gist.github.com/GalloDaSballo/7b060bb97de09c539ec64c533dd352c6

I commented out the function that gives you issues, that may have some impact

Hey everyone, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Hp5UiwQnR1PCyS_-bZVpuO_xJZcPUfbFR-s9w8E3HO0) if you plan on submitting work for the fv component. Once filled out a key for the prover will be sent to you (can take up to 12 hours). Thank you.


[10/25/2023 12:36] _3doc_
question on certora CVL (total noob disclaimer): I struggle to find in the docs what is the syntax to get the called contract address... there is a `currentContract` placeholder but not sure if that's the right place (and if so how) to extract an address from... would anybody know it?


[10/25/2023 13:58] teryanarmen
currentContract will be the address.


[10/25/2023 13:58] teryanarmen
Also, the best place to ask prover related questions is the help-desk channel in the [Certora discord](https://discord.gg/certora) as more of our team is monitoring that channel.

[10/28/2023 19:15] alextheentreprenerd
It‚Äôs missing the dependencies, check the readme to import submodules and run yarn


[10/28/2023 20:43] debofx
You might need to run foundryup as well.


[10/28/2023 20:55] shahen.0000
Got the same error but fixed it, Goto root an yarn first, Also if your using the latest node version wont work, Instead of downgrading use NVM so youll be able to switch between versions, So install node version 16 then `nvm use 16` then install yarn, run yarn on root, then cd to packages/contracts and forge build


[10/29/2023 08:19] alextheentreprenerd
We have a docker image which is tested to work as well that should help

@TK | csjaybit Did you read the README in certora folder?


[10/29/2023 09:37] csjaybit
didnt quiet understood some terms


[10/29/2023 09:38] teryanarmen
Which ones? real bug is a bug found in the code and submitted through c4 and rewarded. mutation is a code change introduced in a separate contract to test coverage of the properties verified. You can see examples of mutations in the certora/mutations folder.

[10/29/2023 09:55] teryanarmen
Only if you write a valid property that would pass once the bug is fixed.

Hey, just to verify I understood, as a CDP owner you might have your CDP closed involuntarily by someone redeeming eBTC and your CDP being next on the sortedCDPs list?


[10/29/2023 16:39] alextheentreprenerd
Yes


[10/29/2023 19:25] pxng0lin
Where can i find more info on these:

    /// @param _upperHint The expected CdpId of neighboring higher ICR within SortedCdps, could be simply bytes32(0)
    /// @param _lowerHint The expected CdpId of neighboring lower ICR within SortedCdps, could be simply bytes32(0)


[10/29/2023 19:25] pxng0lin
Part of the `openCDP(...)` function in BorrowerOperations.sol


[10/29/2023 19:28] pxng0lin
Niroh can you elaborate on this for me, why would your CDP be closed involuntarily? Is this because its below your ICR and can be liquidated?


[10/30/2023 04:28] stryder1496

Hey, sorry if this was asked and I missed it, but wasn't there a bot-race for this audit? All I found was the 4naly3er report in the details and it look pretty lean (only a few gas optimizations), doesn't seem like anything custom race bots produced (just checking before submitting some Low findings to make sure they're not considered known).

Hi. I'd like some help to understand the Certora Prover outputs, when running it with mutations. I've just started using it, so it can get confusing.

So this is a run on the "standard" repo, right after forking it (so no modification yet). I've run the provided command `certoraMutate --prover_conf certora/confs/CollSurplusPool_verified.conf --mutation_conf certora/confs/gambit/CollSurplusPool.conf`, so on the `CollSurplusPool` specifications.

There are a total of 12 jobs ran, 10 of which are "2/2 Verified", 1 is "1/2 Verified" and 1 is "0/2 Verified". I've ran it several time, and I can always find one rule failing, with different parameters each time. Precisely the one I don't quite understand.

This is this one, with the `changeToCollateralBalance` failing on `claimSurplusCollShares`. And here is the link to the UI: https://prover.certora.com/output/92857/4187c5ff1ce646b19ee77ea687629590/.

The rule being verified is rather simple (screenshot 1). Check that the balance *after* the call is lower than *before* only when the caller is authorized or the `borrowerOperationsAddress`.

In fact, if the caller is not the `borrowerOperationsAddress`, the call should never reach any point after the `_requireCallerIsBorrowerOperations();` check in the `claimSurplusCollShares` function from the `CollSurplusPool` contract. The thing is, from how it is presented in the Prover UI, that it seems to happen anyway.

The broken rule demonstrates that the balance before is `1` and after is `0`, when in fact the caller is neither authorized or the `borrowerOperationsAddress` (screenshot 2). And we can see from the call trace that the call goes right through the check and performs the operations, although the caller is not at all that restricted address (screenshot 3 & 4).

Basically, the `_requireCallerIsBorrowerOperations()` precondition seems to be completely bypassed. I just don't understand how this can happen.

[11/08/2023 17:20] 0xpolarzero
My intuition tells me that it might actually be a mutation, on which maybe the check was removed. But in this case, is there any way on the UI to see how the contract was modified?


[11/08/2023 17:20] 0xpolarzero
Please let me know if this is not the place to discuss this, and I'll move the discussion to the Certora Discord

[11/08/2023 17:36] teryanarmen
You are running the mutation testing and not just the spec. This will inject bugs and send them off with the same spec to see what bugs will be caught. This is how we determine coverage (we use different mutations, mostly high sometimes medium severity and not caught by any spec in the repo now). Does this clarify things? You can dm me also or reach out in the certora help-desk if I am not available.

[11/08/2023 18:18] 0xpolarzero
Ok got it! Thanks for the clarification. So I can't know for each job what these injected bugs are actually, right?


[11/08/2023 18:51] 7a4raf
the only public mutations are the ones in the mutations folder, but for coverage, the injected mutation are private and I think they will not get released until the resuls are out


[11/08/2023 18:54] teryanarmen
You can if you run certoraMutate, you will get something like [this](https://mutation-testing.certora.com/?id=e88e640b-cb0c-4ea9-85ca-a5c6db926bee&anonymousKey=4bb274d5-442c-4fd3-ac46-441532a2f9f2) where it shows some random mutants generated by gambit along with any manual ones as specified in the gambit conf found in certora/confs/gambit/*.conf. And yes the private mutations are not in the contracts or in the repo, they will be used to evaluate the results and shared with the rewards.


[11/08/2023 19:32] 0xpolarzero
Oh ok thanks, that's interesting. And yes, got it about the private mutations. That's exciting!

@Alex The Entreprenerd What's the meaning of Cdp.stake, and what's the difference between Cdp.stake and Cdp.coll?


[11/10/2023 09:27] alextheentreprenerd
Stake is used for redistribution, while coll is the actual shares balance

I think in most cases they match but they may have different values at times (during a redistribution)


[11/10/2023 09:29] yanchuan1
@Alex The Entreprenerd Is there a test case in the codebase?

it's a good question - I can't answer that definitely off the top of my head. would have to go through the state machine to confirm.


[11/13/2023 14:08] codingnamekiki
- The system goes into usingFallbackChainlinkUntrusted, next time fetchPrice is called and the fallback is either broken or frozen then the system will return the lastGoodPrice which will be the last chainlink price.

- The system goes into usingFallbackChainlinkUntrusted, next time fetchPrice is called and the fallback is neither broken or frozen then the system will both return the fallback response and store it as the new value of lastGoodPrice.

when status is usingFallbackChainlinkUntrusted, lastGoodPrice can be both the chainlink price and the fallback price, depending on the situation, hopefully thats more understandable.

@thebrittfactor | C4 hi when u send awards , can u give me some gas fee for polygon, (deduct it from my awards ) is it possible? , im stuck with usdc ,


[12/13/2023 05:55] lourenslinde
I got you. Feel free to DM your rewards address if you want.

Alternatively gasbot.xyz is  great to get gas into another chain.

i was too dumb üòÇ  although i am trying to be security researcher , i don't even know those things exist üòÇ ü§£ , i got it with gas bot , thanks anyway


[12/13/2023 13:49] 7a4raf
are rewards distributed yet?


[12/13/2023 13:56] saaj_110
next time just try polygon swap as it is free and if want to bridge token to other chain use hop exchange as they are cost efficient..gas bot still is expensive

[12/29/2023 17:58] 7a4raf
if you mean the normal audit competition, yes the rewards are out and sent
-check for a transaction on https://polygonscan.com/ using your wallet address
-if you found a transaction, try importing USDC coin inside your wallet on the Polygon network
-if you can't find a transaction try opening a help-desk request 
if you mean the formal verification competition, the results are not out yet, only preliminary results are out

@ü¶ô liveactionllama | C4 I send you a dm, did you see it?


[01/12/2024 23:46] liveactionllamac4
Hi! It gets pretty difficult to monitor all incoming DMs in a big community like this, especially since they often end up outside of my main inbox. üòÖ If you have a question or concern, it is typically best to submit a [help request](https://code4rena.com/help) so that our team can review and respond! üôÇ


[01/13/2024 05:22] benrai
Good to know, I will do so, thanks üòä
